abstract= "Measuring interestingness in between data items is one of the key steps in association rule mining. To assess interestingness, after the introduction of the classical measures (support, confidence and lift), over 40 different measures have been published in the literature. Out of the large variety of proposed measures, it is very difficult to select the appropriate measures in a concrete decision support scenario. In this paper, based on the diversity of measures proposed to date, we conduct a preliminary study to identify the most typical and useful roles of the measures of interestingness. The research on selecting useful measures of interestingness according to their roles will not only help to decide on optimal measures of interestingness, but can also be a key factor in proposing new measures of interestingness in association rule mining.",

abstract= "Over the last decades, various decision support technologies have gained massive ground in practice and theory. Out of these technologies, statistical reasoning was used widely to elucidate insights from data. Later, we have seen the emergence of online analytical processing (OLAP) and association rule mining, which both come with specific rationales and objectives. Unfortunately, both OLAP and association rule mining have been introduced with their own specific formalizations and terminologies. This made and makes it always hard to reuse results from one domain in another. In particular, it is not always easy to see the potential of statistical results in OLAP and association rule mining application scenarios. This paper aims to bridge the artificial gaps between the three decision support techniques, i.e., statistical reasoning, OLAP, and association rule mining and contribute by elaborating the semantic correspondences between their foundations, i.e., probability theory, relational algebra, and the itemset apparatus. Based on the semantic correspondences, we provide that the unification of these techniques can serve as a foundation for designing next-generation multi-paradigm data mining tools.",

abstract= "Big data is driving growth of businesses, data is the money, big data is the fuel of the twenty-first century, and there are many other claims over Big Data. Can we, however, rely on big data blindly? What happens if the training data set of a machine learning module is incorrect and contains a statistical paradox? Data, like fossil fuels, is valuable, but it must be refined carefully for the best results. Statistical paradoxes are difficult to observe in a dataset, but they are very important to analyze in every small or big dataset. In this paper, we look at the three important statistical paradoxes in data and demonstrate how they affect the artificial intelligence, data science and big datasets. We provide that statistical paradoxes are more common in a variety of data and it leads to wrong conclusions potentially with harmful consequences. Case studies, experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets clearly showcase that the statistical paradoxes are severely harmful for big data and artificial intelligence based applications.",
