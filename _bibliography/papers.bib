abstract={The size of data collected around the world is growing exponentially, and it has become popular as big data. The volume and velocity of big data are facilitating the transition of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) from research laboratories to real life. There are numerous other claims made about Big Data. Can we, however, rely on data blindly? What happens when a dataset used to train ML models has a hidden statistical paradox? Data, like fossil fuels, is valuable, but it must be refined carefully for accurate outcomes. Statistical paradoxes are hard to observe in classical data cleaning and analysis techniques. Still, they are required to be investigated separately in training datasets. In this paper, we discuss the impact of Simpson's paradox on categorical data and demonstrate its effects on AI and ML application scenarios. Next, we provide an algorithm to automatically identify the confounding variable and detect Simpson's paradox within categorical datasets. The algorithm experiments on datasets from two real-world case studies. The outcome of the algorithm uncovers the existence of the paradox and indicates that Simpson's paradox is severely harmful in automatic data analysis, especially in AI, ML and DL.},

abstract="In the last two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have grown tremendously. However, understanding and assessing the impacts of causality and statistical paradoxes are still some of the critical challenges in their domains. Currently, these terms are widely discussed within the context of explainable AI (XAI) and algorithmic fairness. However, they are still not in the mainstream AI and ML application development scenarios. In this paper, first, we discuss the impact of Simpson's paradox on linear trends, i.e., on continuous values, and then we demonstrate its effects via three benchmark training datasets used in ML. Next, we provide an algorithm for detecting Simpson's paradox. The algorithm has experimented with the three datasets and appears beneficial in detecting the cases of Simpson's paradox in continuous values. In future, the algorithm can be utilized in designing a certain next-generation platform for fairness in ML.",

abstract= "Over the last decades, various decision support technologies have gained massive ground in practice and theory. Out of these technologies, statistical reasoning was used widely to elucidate insights from data. Later, we have seen the emergence of online analytical processing (OLAP) and association rule mining, which both come with specific rationales and objectives. Unfortunately, both OLAP and association rule mining have been introduced with their own specific formalizations and terminologies. This made and makes it always hard to reuse results from one domain in another. In particular, it is not always easy to see the potential of statistical results in OLAP and association rule mining application scenarios. This paper aims to bridge the artificial gaps between the three decision support techniques, i.e., statistical reasoning, OLAP, and association rule mining and contribute by elaborating the semantic correspondences between their foundations, i.e., probability theory, relational algebra, and the itemset apparatus. Based on the semantic correspondences, we provide that the unification of these techniques can serve as a foundation for designing next-generation multi-paradigm data mining tools.",

Data, like fossil fuels, is valuable, but it must be refined carefully for the best results. Statistical paradoxes are difficult to observe in datasets, but they are significant to analyse in every small or big dataset. In this paper, we discuss the role of statistical paradoxes on Big data. Mainly we discuss the impact of Berkson’s paradox and Simpson's paradox on different types of data and demonstrate how they affect big data. We provide that statistical paradoxes are more common in a variety of data and they lead to wrong conclusions potentially with harmful consequences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and a case study indicate that statistical paradoxes are severely harmful to big data and automatic data analysis techniques.",

abstract="Since its introduction in the 1990s, association rule mining(ARM) has been proven as one of the essential concepts in data mining; both in practice as well as in research. Discretization is the only means to deal with numeric target column in today's association rule mining tools. However, domain experts and decision-makers are used to argue in terms of mean values when it comes to numeric target values. In this paper, we provide a tool that reports mean values of a chosen numeric target column concerning all possible combinations of influencing factors -- so-called grand reports. We give an in-depth explanation of the functionalities of the proposed tool. Furthermore, we compare the capabilities of the tool with one of the leading association rule mining tools, i.e., RapidMiner. Moreover, the study delves into the motivation of grand reports and offers some useful insight into their theoretical foundation.",

abstract="In association rule mining, both the classical algorithms and today's available tools either use binary data items or discretized data. However, in real-world scenarios, data are available in many different forms (numerical, text) and these types of data items are not supported in the classical association rule mining algorithms. There are some association rule mining algorithms that have been proposed for numerical data items but unfortunately, for working data scientists and decision makers, it is challenging to find concrete algorithms that fit their purposes best. Therefore, it is highly desired to have a study on the different existing numerical association rule mining algorithms (NARM). In this paper, we provide such a detailed study by thoroughly reviewing 24 NARM algorithms from different categories (optimization, discretization, distribution).",

	abstract = {In data mining, the classical association rule mining techniques deal with binary attributes; however, real-world data have a variety of attributes (numerical, categorical, Boolean). To deal with the variety of data attributes, the classical association rule mining technique was extended to numerical association rule mining. Initially, the concept of numerical association rule mining started with the discretization method, and later, many other methods, e.g., optimization, distribution are proposed in state-of-the-art. Different authors have presented various algorithms for each numerical association rule mining method; therefore, it is hard to select a suitable algorithm for a numerical association rule mining task. In this article, we present a systematic assessment of various numerical association rule mining methods and we provide a meta-study of thirty numerical association rule mining algorithms. We investigate how far the discretization techniques have been used in the numerical association rule mining methods.},

abstract="Many real-world data sets contain a mix of various types of data, i.e., binary, numerical, and categorical; however, many data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms work merely with discrete values, e.g., association rule mining. Therefore, the discretization process plays an essential role in data mining and ML. In state-of-the-art data mining and ML, different discretization techniques are used to convert numerical attributes into discrete attributes. However, existing discretization techniques do not reflect best the impact of the independent numerical factor onto the dependent numerical target factor. This paper proposes and compares two novel measures for order-preserving partitioning of numerical factors that we call Least Squared Ordinate-Directed Impact Measure and Least Absolute-Difference Ordinate-Directed Impact Measure. The main aim of these measures is to optimally reflect the impact of a numerical factor onto another numerical target factor. We implement the proposed measures for two-partitions and three-partitions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed measures by comparison with human-perceived cut-points. We use twelve synthetic data sets and one real-world data set for the evaluation, i.e., school teacher salaries from New Jersey (NJ). As a result, we find that the proposed measures are useful in finding the best cut-points perceived by humans.",
